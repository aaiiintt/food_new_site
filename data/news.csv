These are thought to slow digestion and weaken Qi. Avoid excess Yang foods (hot, stimulating, drying): Spicy foods, fried foods, alcohol, and excessive red meat, which can overheat the body. Emphasize neutral and balanced foods like grains, legumes, vegetables, and mild herbs to maintain internal harmony. Qi-Enhancing Foods. Foods that support life force (Qi) include whole grains (millet, rice), beans, mushrooms, nuts, and herbal soups. Foods rich in ""Jing"" (essential energy) include black sesame seeds, goji berries, walnuts, and seaweed, which are thought to promote longevity. Seasonal and Local Eating. Spring: Light, fresh foods like sprouts and greens. Summer: Cooling foods like cucumbers and melons. Autumn: Root vegetables and hearty grains. Winter: Warming foods like soups, stews, and warming herbs. And ethics. "
